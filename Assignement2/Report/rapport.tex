		\subsection{Statments to be proven}
			\subsubsection{Question 1: Prove that depth-first is a special case of uniform-cost search}
				If the tree that is build is such as the cost of the nodes increments by one following the path of an actual depth-search, the uniform-cost will follow that same path and thus perform a depth-first search.
				
			\subsubsection{Question 2: Prove that breadth-first is a special case of uniform-cost search}	
				In the simple case where all the nodes have the exact same cost, the uniform-search will run through the tree by level exactly like a breadth-first search.
			\subsubsection{Question 3: Prove that greedy-best-first search is a special case of A*}
				The f(n) function of an A* search is g(n) + h(n), which is the sum of the exact cost from the beginning to a node n and the extimated cost provided by the heuristic. In a greedy-best first, g(n) is equal to zero and thus it is a special case of A* where we do not take into account the cost to get to the node n. 
			\subsubsection{Question 4: Prove that uniform-cost is a special case of A*}
				This is pretty much the same idea than Q3, only here, it is h(n) that is equal to zero which means that we do not use a heuristic. f(n) is equal only to g(n) that represent the cost from the beginning to the node n.
			
			\subsubsection{Question 5: Prove that if a heuristic is consistent, then it is admissible}
				\begin{proof}
					Let's take the triangle inequality of the consistency and develop it:
					$$ h(n) \leq c(n,a,n') + h(n') $$
					Where node n' is the successor of node n through the action a.\\ 
					Adding g(n), the exact cost to node n, left and right:
					$$ g(n) + h(n) \leq g(n) + c(n,a,n') + h(n') $$
					Simplifying the right part by summing the first two terms:
					$$ g(n) + h(n) \leq g(n') + h(n') $$
					This expression indicates that $$ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) $$ is optimistic and underestimates the cost of a deeper node. Let's say that n' is the goal (and so, h(n)==0), and can be reach by any set of action from node n, we get:
					$$ g(n) + h(n) \leq g(n') $$
					This is the definition of admissibility.
				\end{proof}\\
				We have thus prove that a consistent heuristic is admissible.

		\subsection{Question 1: As illustrated on Figure 3 some situations cannot lead to a solution. Are there other similar situations? If yes, describe them.}
			
			There is another situation that cannot lead to a solution, that is when a block is against a wall and must go in a perpendicular direction w.r.t. that wall as shown on the representation below: \\
	\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
		\# & \# & \# & \# & \# \\ 
		\# &    &    &    & \# \\ 
		\# & .  &    & \$ & \# \\ 
		\# &    &    &    & \# \\ 
		\# & \# & \# & \# & \# \\ 
	\end{tabular}\\
	In this cas, the box is stuck against the right wall and it will never be possible to push it to the left to reach the goal.
	In the of a goal being against a wall, there is a dead state if two boxes a pushed against that wall as shown on the exemple below: \\
	\begin{tabular}{ccccccccc}
		\# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# \\ 
		\# &    & .  &    & \$ &    & \$ &    & \# \\ 
		\# &    &    &    &    &    &    &    & \# \\ 
		\# &    &    &    &    &    &    &    & \# \\ 
		\# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# \\ 
	\end{tabular}\\
	The box on the right will be able to go on the goal but the one on the right is in the same position as explain above, although there is a goal against the same wall as it.
