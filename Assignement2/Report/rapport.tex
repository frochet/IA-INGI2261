	\section{Search Algorithms}
		\subsection{Statments to be proven}
			\subsubsection{Question 1: Prove that depth-first is a special case of uniform-cost search}
				If the tree that is build is such as the cost of the nodes increments by one following the path of an actual depth-search, the uniform-cost will follow that same path and thus perform a depth-first search.
				
			\subsubsection{Question 2: Prove that breadth-first is a special case of uniform-cost search}	
				In the simple case where all the nodes have the exact same cost, the uniform-search will run through the tree by level exactly like a breadth-first search.
			\subsubsection{Question 3: Prove that greedy-best-first search is a special case of A*}
				The f(n) function of an A* search is g(n) + h(n), which is the sum of the exact cost from the beginning to a node n and the extimated cost provided by the heuristic. In a greedy-best first, g(n) is equal to zero and thus it is a special case of A* where we do not take into account the cost to get to the node n. 
			\subsubsection{Question 4: Prove that uniform-cost is a special case of A*}
				This is pretty much the same idea than Q3, only here, it is h(n) that is equal to zero which means that we do not use a heuristic. f(n) is equal only to g(n) that represent the cost from the beginning to the node n.
			
			\subsubsection{Question 5: Prove that if a heuristic is consistent, then it is admissible}
				\begin{proof}
					Let's procede by in a recursive way, using the consitency definition :
					$$ h(n) \leq c(n,a,n') + h(n') $$
					We assume first that n' is the goal, and thus, h(g) equals 0 by definition. We get
					$$ h(n) \leq c(n,a,g) $$
					Where n is the node strictly before reaching the goal. We see that h is admissible for this node. We can now start the recursion like so:
					$$ h(n) \leq c(n,a,n') + h(n') $$
					Knowing that h(n') is admissible, we can set an upper bound for h(n') that is the exact minimal cost to the goal and can write the above as:
					$$ h(n) \leq c(n,a,n') + C*(n', g) $$
					The right term can thus be written as:
					$$ h(n) \leq C*(n, g) $$
					Which is the definition of admissibility.				
				\end{proof}\\
				We have thus prove that a consistent heuristic is admissible.
				
		\subsection{A* versus uniform-cost search}
			\subsubsection{Question 1: Give a consistent heuristic for this problem. Prove that it is admissible}
				A consistent heuristic for this problem is to use h(n) = manhattan distance from n to the goal. We will prove that it is consistent and thanks to the result of question 1.5, we are sure that it will be admissible too.
				\begin{proof}
					To prove that this heuristic is consistent and thus, admissible, we consider that the consistency statement is false and get:
					$$ h(n) > c(n,a,n') + h(n') $$
					Where "a" is a move in any of the cardinal directions.
					By subtracting h(n') on both side we get:
					$$ h(n) - h(n') > c(n,a,n') $$
					The manhattan distance heuristic should have a cost of 1 per action and accordingly to the latter expression, it is at least of 2 because c(n,a,n') is equal to 1.\\
					This is impossible and thus, the statement of consistency must be true.\\
					Because the heuristic is consistent, it is admissible as proved earlier. 	
				\end{proof}		
				
			\subsubsection{Question 2: Show on the left maze the states (board positions) that are visited during an execution of A* graph search with a manhattan distance heuristic (ignoring walls). A state is visited when it is selected in the fringe and expanded. In the A* algorithm, we assume that when different states in the fringe have the smallest value, the algorithm chooses the state with the smallest coordinate (i, j) ((0, 0) being the bottom left position, i being the horizontal index and j the vertical one) using a lexicographical order}
				For the following search, when looking at the children of a node, we start looking to the north and continue clockwise.

				\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
					\hline 
					  &    &    &    &    &    &   \\

				The path that is retained by the A* search using the manhattan distance heuristic is the following : \{1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20\}. The numbers indicates in which order the nodes are seen.

			\subsubsection{Show on the right maze the board positions visited by a uniform-cost graph search. When several states have the smallest path cost, this uniform-cost search visits them in the same lexicographical order as A*}

	\section{Sokoban planning problem}
	
		\subsection{Question 1: As illustrated on Figure 3 some situations cannot lead to a solution. Are there other similar situations? If yes, describe them.}
			
			There is another situation that cannot lead to a solution, that is when a block is against a wall and must go in a perpendicular direction w.r.t. that wall as shown on the representation below: \\
	\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
		\# & \# & \# & \# & \# \\ 
		\# &    &    &    & \# \\ 
		\# & .  &    & \$ & \# \\ 
		\# &    &    &    & \# \\ 
		\# & \# & \# & \# & \# \\ 
	\end{tabular}\\
	In this cas, the box is stuck against the right wall and it will never be possible to push it to the left to reach the goal.
	In the of a goal being against a wall, there is a dead state if two boxes a pushed against that wall as shown on the exemple below: \\
	\begin{tabular}{ccccccccc}
		\# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# \\ 
		\# &    & .  &    & \$ &    & \$ &    & \# \\ 
		\# &    &    &    &    &    &    &    & \# \\ 
		\# &    &    &    &    &    &    &    & \# \\ 
		\# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# & \# \\ 
	\end{tabular}\\
	The box on the right will be able to go on the goal but the one on the right is in the same position as explain above, although there is a goal against the same wall as it.
